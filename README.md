# canscan

This is an implementation of the port scanner from the [Black Hat Go](https://nostarch.com/blackhatgo) exercise (in Crystal though obviously :smile:)

## Development

For now canscan is a direct implementation of the code exercise from the book. I may develop it further into a console app for fun later.
